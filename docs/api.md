# Using sentinel APIs
Sentinel monitoring exposes a rich set of APIs for user and space management. The current release of sentinel has APIs supporting bare-minimal features and as the features set get richer, so will be the APIs. Below are the list of APIs currently offered by the framework -

* /v1/api/ - shows list of supported APIs
* /v1/api/user/ - everything to do with user management
* /v1/space/ - management of monitoring space
* /v1/series/ - management of series with any space
* /v1/api/key/ - API to retrieve user's API key if forgotten
* /v1/api/endpoint - API to retrieve Sentinel's data interface parameters
