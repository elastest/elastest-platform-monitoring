# Sentinel agents
Currently three sentinel agents are available and more are being planned and will be released in the near future.
* docker stats agent
* system stats agent
* logfile agent
* inline logging guidelines

In addition, it is very easy to use inline code to directly send your logs into sentinel. All agents are written in **Python3** and need **pip3** to install all dependencies.
